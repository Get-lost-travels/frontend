    title: "Alpine Zoo Innsbruck and Hungerburg Funicular",
    motto: "What could be nicer on a quiet, sunny day than a trip to the zoo with the family?",
    description: `The zoo is the only one of its kind worldwide. At 750 meters, it is Europe’s highest-lying zoo, but it is also easy to get to and not far from the city center.

There are many different animals waiting to be seen at the zoo such as lynx, eagles, fish, and birds, as well as wolves and bears. Spring is a particularly interesting time to visit because that is when young animals are born and there is usually a lot going on! At the petting area, rare and local species of cows, pigs, goats and sheep can be seen up close.

The ride with the Hungerburgbahn starts at the Station Congress near the center of Innsbruck and brings you in 5 minutes to the Station Alpine Zoo, then back again after your zoo visit.`,
